## How It Works

The app creates a decision matrix where:

- **Cells**: Grades (1-10) and notes for each combination

The app automatically calculates:
- Total scores for each choice
- Average scores
- Rankings with medals (ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰)

Use the pivot button to swap the axes for a different perspective on your data!
