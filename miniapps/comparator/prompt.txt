i want a streamlit app to help make comparisons between multiple choices, user can input the choices and the criteria, and note by text for each choice-criteria and also add a grade for each criteria

x axis is criteria, and y axis are choices, user can push a button to pivot these 2 axis
make the grade box a tiny one, to the right of note box
make the default grade 0. and make the x axis scrollable

add default test for when the page renders:
- choices: vinfast, yadea
- critera: speed, price


About the app, code-wise:
- Make the app hot reload.
- Split code logic into readable functions, following good coding standards
- Give me a test file in yaml format, with two keys, choices: [] and critera: []
- In main app, give an environment variable on whether to start the app with default choices or not, default of this environment is true


About the test:
Generate random for choices and critera (at least 10), notes and grades

read the prompt and modify accordingly
