# Why do we use requirements.in?
# #1: Your requirements.txt contains just the first degree dependencies and their versions. Your dependencies also have dependencies (2nd+ degree), and these versions are not necessarily locked down -> solution: pip freeze > requirements.txt
# #2: Pip freeze introduce new problem: once you want to delete a dependency, how do you know that youâ€™ve deleted all their dependencies?
# ==> Solution: use pip-compile by requirements.in
